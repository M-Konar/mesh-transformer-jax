"Indeed, what is the difference?" asks the father. ''Sure, I'll go.''

The next day, the boy comes home from school "Dad, have you gone by the school?" He asks.

"Not yet."

"Well when you do, come and see the gym teacher also."

"Why?" asks the father.

The boy explains, "Well we had a gym class today, and he asked me to raise my left arm, I did. Then my right arm, I also raised it. Then he asked me to lift my right leg, so I did. 'Now,' he says, 'lift your left leg,' so I asked 'What, am I suppose to stand on my cock!?'"

"Exactly," says the father. "Alright, I'll come."

The next day, the boy asks his father "Did you go to the school?"

"No, not yet."

"Don't bother, I got expelled."

Surprised, the father asks "Why did you get expelled?"

 His club and insurance company ensured that a large sum of money went his way.

One day, he decided to invest his money in a small but growing sportswear business. 

He bought the company outright but after signing on the dotted line, realized that he knew nothing about business. 

He decided to employ someone to run the shop.

The next day he set up three interviews. 

The first guy was great. 

He knew everything he needed to and was very enthusiastic. 

At the end of the interview, the former rugby player asked him, “Do you notice anything different about me?”

And the man replied, “Why, yes, I couldn’t help noticing you have no ears.” 

The rugby player got angry and threw him out.

The second interview was with a woman, and she was even better than the first guy. 

He asked her the same question, “Do you notice anything different about me?”

She replied: “Well, you have no ears.” 

He got upset again and showed her the door.

The third and last interview was with the best of the three. 

He was a very young man fresh out of college. 

He was smart and handsome and seemed to know all about the sportswear business.

The rugby player was anxious, but went ahead and asked him the same question: “Do you notice anything different about me?”

To his surprise the young man answered: “Yes, you wear contact lenses.”

The former rugby player was shocked, and said, “What an incredibly observant young man you are. How in the world did you know that?”

The young man fell off his chair laughing hysterically and replied, “Well, it’s pretty hard to wear glasses with no flipping ears!”<|endoftext|>A man was in his front yard mowing grass when his attractive blonde female !!|A man was in his front yard mowing grass when his attractive blonde female neighbor came out of the house and went straight to the mail box.

As the man was getting ready to edge the lawn, here she came out again, marched to the mail box, opened it and then slammed it closed harder than ever.

One night they are out at the pub, having a couple drinks, and Seamus turns to Mary and asks "D'ya fancy going home and doing a load of laundry?"

Mary looks at Seamus and says "you know that sounds lovely. Let's do."

They finish their drinks and head home together. 

At home they are sitting in front of the fire, Seamus smoking his pipe and Mary with her knitting. Seamus asks "Mary? D'ya still fancy that load of laundry?" 

Mary looks at Seamus and says "aye I do, I really do. Let me just finish my knitting."

So Seamus gets up and heads to the bed room. 

Mary keeps knitting and forgets all about Seamus. 

After an hour she realizes she forgot and jumps up and rushes to the bedroom. "Seamus?" Mary asks, "D'ya still fancy doing a load of laundry?"

One night a blind man stops by the stand.

"What would you like to purchase today?" asks the cashier.

"Oh, nothing" the blind man says, "I was just *looking* around!"

An few hours later, a deaf man approaches the stand.  The cashier realizes he can't hear him, and uses sign-language to ask what he'd like to purchase.

"Well, I *heard* you guys are having a sale!" the deaf man states with a wink and a nudge.

Finally, just before that night's closing time, a muscular man with no apparent disability walks up to the stand.  The cashier asks what he'd like to purchase.

"I don't know ... I heard you guys sold *cherries*!" the man states with a look of subtle expectation.

The cashier, despite going through his mental checklist of code-phrases, has no idea what he wants.

"I'm sorry, we've sold-out on that item." the cashier says with a puzzled stare.

"Ah *motherfucking* christ!" the man screams in pseudo-frustration.  However, the cashier just stands there with an agitated face.

The customer, realizing his attempts aren't getting through to the employee, tries a different approach.

"Well, that's a darn shame!" he continues. 
"And I travelled across the entire *count-*" 

The man coughs.

"Hey," he says. "Need a lift?"

The priest shakes his head. "No thank you, I have faith that the lord will save me. Use your boat to find those more in need."

The rowboat heads off, and soon the water is up to the priest's chest.  A rescue boat loaded with supplies comes racing up to him.

"Grab my hand!" the captain yells. "We gotta get out of here!"

"No!" The priest yells. "There are others who need help. I assure you, the lord will save me!"

Reluctantly, the rescue boat rides off.

As the water continues to rise, the priest is forced to the roof of his house. A helicopter flies over to him and lowers a winch.

"Hold on!" Shouts the winchman as he holds out his hand.

But the priest again shakes his head. "No! The lord will save me! Go save someone else!"

Frustrated, the helicopter flies away. 

Sadly, the water becomes too much for the priest to deal with and he goes under.

He finds himself in heaven, absolutely stunned. After going through the pearly gates, he walks straight up to God himself.

"Lord," the priest says, "I spent my life devoted to you. I truly believed that you would protect me through the hardest times in my life. Yet when I needed you most, when my life was at stake, you weren't there for me!"

"What are you talking about?" God replies. "I sent two boats a
